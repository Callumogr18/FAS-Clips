# FAS-Clips
FAS stands for "Football Analysis System", it is designed to help me and others better understand the sport I and billions around the globelove. It allows a user to observe statistics of the match including team posession, team-mates, opposition, exact ball position on the field and more.  

# Technologies Used
FAS implmeneted the use of data analytics and machine learning frameworks. I incorporated Yolo, which helped me with object detection, this came in handy when differentiating the two teams from each other and the referees on the pitch, who can all then be colour-coded accordingly. Supervision helped to actually keep track of the ball as it was passed around the pitch and allowed me to record these positions. Pickle was very helpful as it helped me in pre-processing data and speeding up the programme's overall speed. Scikit-learn was used in helping me assign colours in order to figure out which team a player was on by clustering an image. Popular frameworks like NumPy and Pandas were also used for data manipulation and various analytics

# Conclusion
FAS has been a success at providing me and my friends new and interesting insights into the sport I love. It also introduced me to the world of machine learning and data analytics which will prove useful in the future as I progress onto better and larger projects in this area.
